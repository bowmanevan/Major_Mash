Unity Project for Honors contract of CSC 1310 by Ty Aherns and Christopher Bowman. The game itself is very barebones and the main gameplay loop is two players taking turns clciking a card. The games goes until a player picks the loser card. The card are shuffled everytime so the loser card is randomized. We orginally had the idea of making a pvp card game woth decks based on college majors (hence the name Major Mash), but decided to piviot to a much simpler concept due to both being full time students in an engineering degree. You can actually see the branch Christopher made called piviot when went for a simpler game. This was our first time working with Unity and C#, so overall we are proud of what were able to acomplish in a semster. Set your ambitions to the Moon so even if you fail, you land among the stars!
